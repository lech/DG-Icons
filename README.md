# Drinking Game Icons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About
These are the official Icons used for the [Bar Room Heroes](http://www.team-brh.com/) TF2 [Drinking Game](https://github.com/codingprimate/drinkinggame)!

These icons were originally conceived and put to work in 2011 and still in-use on the Bar Room Heroes TF2 servers to this day. In much the same way a [Domination](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Domination) symbol appears for a nemesis, the DG icons appear only for all opposing players participating in the drinking game. The icons were designed to maintain the Team Fortress 2 color theme and style so they can blend in seamlessly.

### Version 1.0
These included only a single icon for both Red and Blu team respectively without any variation.

### Version 2.0
