## About
The Official Icons used for the Team-BRH TF2 [Drinking Game](https://github.com/codingprimate/drinkinggame)! These icons were originally conceived and put to work back in 2011 and still in-use on the Bar Room Heroes TF2 servers to this day. In much the same way a [Domination](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Domination) appears for a nemesis, these icons display to show you other players participating in the drinking game.

### Version 1.0
These included only a single icon for both Red and Blu team respectively.

### Version 2.0
A few more icons with SVG sources coming soon!
