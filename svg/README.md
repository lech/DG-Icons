# DG Icons SVG source

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you will find all of the necessary files used to render the icons. The DG Icons were created in Inkscape with the page value set at 1024 x 1024 pixels. All files are then exported at a reduced size of 128 x 128 pixel as PNG before being imported into VTFEdit for output as VTF.

## DGicons.gpl

This is the GIMP palette created for coloring all the fills and strokes. Unfortunately, the GIMP palette format lacks a way for specifying alpha values so those do not exist.

## DGicons.svg

This file contains ALL of the V2 artwork. All objects are broken out by layer with every layer and object having a distinct ID. There are only two alpha values used throughout:
 - OCT. 192 / HEX. C0 - used in backgboards (circle, bottlecap and nemesis outer).
 - OCT. 238 / HEX. EE - used for contrast and darkening (bullseye and inner nemesis layer).
